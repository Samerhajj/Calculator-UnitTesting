# Basic WPF Scientific Calc

A humble calculator app similar to the default one in Windows 10 built using WPF in Visual Studio 2019 with C# and the .Net framework.

## Motivation

This project was made for few reasons:

1. Gain experience with creating a gui-based program utilizing WPF.
2. Write some (basic, non-exhaustive) unit tests to run against a C# program as I developed it.
3. Become more accustomed to using Visual Studio 2019 as a development environment.

## Unit Testing
1.Learned the fundamentals of unit testing in c#
Applied white and black box testing for both the UI and functionality
Added Acceptance testing
